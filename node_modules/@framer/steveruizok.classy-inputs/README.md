# Classy Inputs

[@stveruizok](http://twitter.com/steveruizok)

Plug and play inputs that use CSS classes for styling.

ðŸŽ‰ New in this version: 
- updated `toggle` with smarter event handling
- DOM toggle events (like onClick) now export the event, the component state, and the component instance
- toggles are easier to control via overrides
- ðŸŽƒ experimental slider input, still a work in progress

## Introduction

Inputs are often very complex, with several parallel states (such as hovered and disabled), each with their own effect on how the component looks and behaves. Unlike many Framer X components that use Framer X's property controls to allow control of a limited set of style options, the components in this collection allow for styling through separately defined CSS classes. As a result, you'll have access to the full range of CSS styles as well as psuedo classes for styled states such as hovered or disabled.

## Usage

- Create a CSS file named `styles.css` in your `code` folder.
- Create classes to use for your inputs.
- Drop a component into your project
- Switch the component to use CSS styles
- Enter the name of your CSS class

[Here's an example](https://gist.github.com/steveruizok/c3e9c9a5daadac17304d6e08730d62e0) of an `styles.css` used in the above project.

## Events

In addition to styles, each input an event that will fire when the user interacts with the component. These are:

```
export const InputOverride: Override = () => {
	return {
		onValueChange: (value) => console.log('Value changed:', value)

export const ButtonOverride: Override = () => ({
		onClick: value => console.log('Clicked:', value)
  })

export const ToggleOverride: Override = () => ({
		onToggle: value => console.log('Toggled:', value)
  })

export const SelectOverride: Override = () => ({
		onSelect: value => console.log('Selected:', value)
  })
```

...and each component will respond to several other interaction events: `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onMouseEnter`, and `onMouseLeave`.

[Here's a full list](https://gist.github.com/steveruizok/8ce5a30e7df9bdcab691628b97685e31) of available overrides.

## Help and Learning

**Q: How do I use the button to Navigate to a different frame?**

**A:** At the moment, links may only be created from Frames. You'll need to add a frame around the button and create a navigation link from that frame. Right click your button, select Add Frame, and then create the link as usual.

**Q: How do I specify options in the Select component?**

**A:** In the _options_ property control, type the options you want in a comma separated list. For example, if I wanted options for "Red", "Green" and "Blue", I'd type "red, green, blue" in the _options_ property control.

**Q: What does `nullable` mean in the Select component?**

**A:** Nullable controls whether the select's default value is `null` (or no value) and whether null is a valid choice later.
